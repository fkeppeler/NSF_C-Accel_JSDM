# Are Joint Species Models better than Single Species Models to predict species- and community-level responses to climate change?

## Project goals
The goal of our project is to fit a joint species distribution model (JSDM) to the northeast USA bottom trawl data and compare its results with single-species models (SDM). A secondary objective is to use the JSDM created to predict species and community response to future climate scenarios in the northeast USA.
